# reactBet

The reactBet is a [landing page](https://nagiatzi.github.io/reactBet/) application of a visionary Betting Company to promote an offer that is going to expired. Localstorage and window.onunload
event were used to store the countdown values. A firebase was set also, to hold the user message and info through the component's state, when submitting the form. 
- 2nd edition without window.onunload (for mobile support) available [here](https://nagiatzi.github.io/mobileBet/)
